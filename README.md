# Executive-Financials-Report
A high level view of three cornerstone financial metrics with insight into product revenue by region (EMEA, APAC, LATM) and country. The MS data wih and its accompanying follow along steps are worth digging into a bit deeper as this is mainly meant to mimick the high-level views enquired by executive leadership. Will be returning to this to hopefully provide a bit more of a granular view on the typical financial metrics with work with in SaaS.
